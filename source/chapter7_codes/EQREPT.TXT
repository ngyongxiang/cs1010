San Francisco.
I felt a strong shock followed by rolling waves.
It lasted a long time.#
Berkeley.
It was mild shaking, rattling windows.
It frightened my dog.#
Palo Alto.
The shaking was very violent.#
Santa Cruz.
The earthquake was very destructive.
It knocked down the chimney on my house.#
Palo Alto.
The extreme shaking made me feel like I was on a
boat in rough sea.#
San Francisco.
I slept right through it.  It was much weaker than our
last earthquake.#
